Version 1.0.3:
  Bug fixes:
  - Unsplitting caused segmentation faults.
  - The connection to GPM remained open during suspend, making GPM useless for
    the duration of the suspend.

Version 1.0.2:
	Fix hanging on exit in the X11 module.

Version 1.0.1:
	Fix compilation on some older compilers, that don't automatically apply
	moves.

Version 1.0.0:
	The API has been overhauled to use more of the features of the C++11
	standard. This release is both binary and API incompatible with previous
	releases.

Version 0.6.4:
	Bug fixes:
	- Bracketed paste mode was not handled correctly due to inadvertent setting
	  of the EKEY_PROTECT bit.

Version 0.6.3:
	Bug fixes:
	- The indicator in list panes would disappear of screen when scrolling
	  beyond the first page.
	- The cursor position after undoing an unindent operation was set
	  incorrectly.

Version 0.6.2:
	Bug fixes:
	- Bracketed-paste mode would hang indefinitely and did not properly
	  recognize line endings.

Version 0.6.1:
	Bug fixes:
	- Key bindings for split windows (F8 and Shift-F8) were broken.

Version 0.6.0:
	New features:
	- Allow replacing of menu items.
	- Make key bindings configurable.
	- Add select-all behavior to text fields.
	- Add delete-line capability to edit window.
	- Add support for the so-called SGR mouse protocol.
	- Allow disabling of claiming the primary selection.
	- Use bracketed-paste mode where available to improve pasting by the
	  terminal itself.
	- Remove support for Xlib, leaving the XCB library as the only library for
	  X11 support. The Xlib version was long untested and broken.
	- Remove support for libsigc++. This has been superseeded by C++11 support,
	  which libsigc++ itself has required now for a long time, removing the
	  value of the libsigc++ library for libt3widget.

	Bug fixes:
	- Improved handling of conjoining Jamo (Hangul).
	- Pressing enter while the color picker is selected in the
	  attribute-selection dialog now activates the OK button as expected.
	- Fix joining an unstarted thread when initialization failed.
	- Correct reporting of libtranscript errors from initialization.

Version 0.5.4:
	- Removes pre-generated Doxygen documentation.
	- Minor updates to Makefile.in for compatibility with Debian packaging.

Version 0.5.3:
	Bug fixes:
	- Fix the returned error on initialization failures. The error was obscured
	  sometimes, leading to the error string "OK" for failed initialization.
	- Fix cursor positioning after goto-line in the edit window, by using the
	  screen position rather than the byte position.

Version 0.5.2:
	Bug fixes:
	- Searching for string in text with non-ASCII characters failed around the
	  non-ASCII characters. Searching for non-ASCII characters did not yield
	  any results. This problem only affected non-regular expression searches.

Version 0.5.1:
	Bug fixes:
	- Fix crash on exit when using GCC for compilation and the X11 module. This
	  crash was caused by destructor/atexit ordering.

Version 0.5.0:
	New features:
	- When compiling with a C++11 compatible compiler, libsigc++ and pthread
	  support is no longer required. This does require that all packages built
	  against libt3widget are also built in C++11 mode. As recent versions
	  libsigc++ also require this, depending on libsigc++ does not prevent this
	  issue.
	- A new function for terminating the main loop from outside of the main
	  loop is provided. It may even be safely called from signal handlers.

	Bug fixes:
	- Fix setting of visible part of the text in the text_field_t when changing
	  the contents using set_text.
	- Fix re-activating an already active popup. Re-activating the currently
	  active popup would cause the popup to be hidden.
	- Fix a segmentation fault when dragging the selection beyond the top of
	  the text area.

Version 0.4.7:
	Bug fixes:
	- Fix crashes due to invisible widgets getting activated through hotkeys.
	- Fix read of uninitialized value.
	- Fix memory leaks in edit widget undo/redo.

Version 0.4.6:
	Bug fixes:
	- Fix movement of cursor after mouse positioning.
	- Fix crash when clicking below the entered text in wrap mode.
	- Fix sanitizing of directory names, which would start at a random point,
	  instead of at the start of the string.

Version 0.4.5:
	Bug fixes:
	- Fix movement of cursor after inserting a tab.
	- Fix movement of cursor on pressing left or right when text is selected.
	- Don't allow pasting of values with filtered characters in text fields.

Version 0.4.4:
	Bug fixes:
	- Remove superfluous / characters from directory names in the file dialog,
	  which prevented .. from working correctly.
	- Fix incorrect value types in return statements in widget_group::is_hotkey.
	- Correctly set the time member in the SelectionNotify events sent for
	  X11 clipboard conversions. This fixes hangs when pasting in other clients.

Version 0.4.3:
	Bug fixes:
	- Don't erase the last line of wrapped text in the edit window.

Version 0.4.2:
	Bug fixes:
	- Allow scroll wheel to function on scrollbar again.
	- Do not (un)indent the bottom line of the selection if the selection starts
	  below the end and on column 0.
	- Properly reset application-keypad mode.
	- Fix several memory leaks related to popups.

Version 0.4.1:
	Bug fixes:
	- Fix a segmentation fault on pressing enter in a text field without drop
	  down list.

Version 0.4.0:
	New features:
	- Draggable menus.
	- Draggable scrollbars.

	Bug fixes:
	- Ensure correct cursor position after line unindent and undo of line
	  unindent (#16).
	- Fix report window for mouse event.
	- Check bounds on arguments to text_buffer_t::calculate_line_pos in
	  edit_window_t::xy_to_text_coordinate.

Version 0.3.0:
	New features:
	- Use libt3window's new functionality to retrieve modifiers.
	- GPM (General Purpose Mouse) support, to enable mouse on the linux console
	  (#11).
	- Implemented search panel for the file pane, such that a user can type
	  (part) of the file name to search (#9).

	Bug fixes:
	- Make single click work for list_pane_t (#3).
	- Update the edit_window_t contents on scrollbar click (#7).
	- Ungrab the mouse if there is a selection in a text-field drop-down list.
	- Hide the drop-down list on pressing enter in a text field.
	- Compile with Large File Support if such support is available on the
	  platform.

Version 0.2.1:
	Bug fixes:
	- Fix a crash on summoning the Open File dialog when the current file is in
	  a non-existent directory.
	- Fix scrollbar slider sizing for texts which do not span the entire
	  screen.

Version 0.2.0:
	New features:
	- New dialog: attribute_selector_t

	  widget_group_t
	- The text to find from a find dialog opened from the edit_window_t widget
	  is now set from the current selection if applicable.

	Miscelaneous:
	- Changed the set_focus call in window_component_t to change the argument
	  from bool to an enum indicating where the focus came from as well.
	- Renamed focus_set to set_child_focus in container_t
	- Added widget_container_t which serves better as a base class for widgets
	  which group multiple widgets together.
	- Added a parameter to widget_t constructor to allow not registering a
	  widget as a mouse target.

	Bug fixes:
	- Update the visual state of a checkbox on calling set_state.
	- Fix menu item drawing after removal of an item from a menu.
	- When file_dialog_t::set_file is called for an unreadable directory, it no
	  longer crashes the program.

Version 0.1.14:
	Miscelaneous:
	- Changed the visibility of ensure_cursor_on_screen in edit_window_t from
	  private to protected.

Version 0.1.13:
	Bug fixes:
	- Prevent unprintable zero-width characters at the start of a line from
	  being printed separately.
	- Fix cursor positioning for zero-width characters at the start of a line.
	- Fix invalid memory access in X11 handling.

Version 0.1.12:
	New features:
	- Much improved mouse handling for text fields and autocomplete pop-ups.

	Bug fixes:
	- Detect broken X11 connections when using XCB, and disable the X11

	New features:
	- Text lines and edit windows now have options for showing tabs.
	- Changed the text_buffer_t API w.r.t. handling of the selection and find
	  results.

	- Added check for required XCB constants, to prevent build failures.

Version 0.1.7:
	New features:
	- Allow finalizing of the library, to allow release of all memory for
	  debugging purposes.
	- Use dlopen/dlsym/dlclose directly if available, instead of using libltdl.
	- The text_window_t widget now also supports mouse actions.
	- Use XCB instead of Xlib if available.
	- Change many classes to use the private implementation idiom, to achieve a
	  more stable ABI.

	Bug fixes:
	- Replace using regular expressions and \1 .. \9 references caused a buffer
	  overrun.
	- Unindent selection would cause a crash if the selection started before
	  the whitespace to be removed.
